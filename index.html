<h2>1945</h2>

Vannevar Bush writes <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/" target="_blank">an article</a>
 in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/world/" target="_blank">Atlantic Monthly</a> about a photo-electrical-mechanical 
 device called a Memex, for memory extension, which could make and follow links between documents on microfiche
 <br/>

<h2>1960s</h2>
Doug Engelbart prototypes an "oNLine System" (NLS) which does hypertext browsing editing, email, and so on. 
He invents the mouse for this purpose. See the Bootstrap Institute library.
<br/><br/>
Ted Nelson coins the word Hypertext in A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate.
 20th National Conference, New York, <a href="https://www.acm.org/" target="_blank">Association for Computing 
Machinery,</a> 1965. See also: Literary Machines. 
 Note: There used to be a link here to "Hypertext and Hypermedia: A Selected Bibliography" by Terence Harpold, 
 but the site hosting the resource did not maintain the link.
<br/><br/>
Andy van Dam and others build the Hypertext Editing System and FRESS in 1967.

<h2>1980</h2>
While consulting for CERN June-December of 1980, Tim Berners-Lee writes a notebook program, "Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything", 
which allows links to be made between arbitrary nodes. Each node had a title, a type, and a list of bidirectional typed links. 
"ENQUIRE" ran on Norsk Data machines under SINTRAN-III. See: <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1980/Enquire/scaled/" target="_blank">Enquire user manual as scanned images</a> 
or as <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1980/Enquire/manual/" target="_blank">HTML page(alt).</a>
